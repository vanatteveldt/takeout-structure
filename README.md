# Social media takeout structure

This tool can be used to extract the structure of social media takeout files, generally zipped json files. It will only extract the name of keys and value types, not the actual value of keys.

As such, it can be used to analyse the structure of takeout files of people without asking them to share any sensitive information with you. 

# Installation and usage

To run the tool locally, use npm:

```
npm i
npm run dev
```
